Our Modern Dance CCA participated in the Super 24 Dance Competition (Secondary Schools Category). The qualifying rounds took place on Saturday, 29 July 2023 at Somerset Skate Park. Our students put up a very impressive performance and qualified for the finals. 

The Super 24  Finals took place on Saturday, 12 August, at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, where 8 schools competed for the championship. Our boys and girls did very well to be in the Top 3 placings. They lost out on the top two positions by only 0.5 points. 

Congratulations to NV Boogie Crew for achieving 3rd placing at Super 24 Finals! We also thanked our parents, teachers and student supporters for cheering on the team at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
