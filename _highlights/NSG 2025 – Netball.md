<p><strong>Netball B Girls Make History as North Zone Champions!</strong>
</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce that our Netball B Girls have made history
by winning their first-ever North Zone Netball Championship title! Their
incredible journey saw them remain undefeated in their last eight games,
displaying skill, resilience, and teamwork at every stage.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated final showdown took place on Friday, 14 March,
at 11:30 AM at the Singapore Sports School, where our girls faced off against
CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School (SNG)—another unbeaten team.</p>
<p><strong>A Hard-Fought Battle</strong>
<br>SNG came out strong, racing to an early six-point lead while our girls
took time to settle into the game. However, once they found their rhythm,
they executed precise passes, made key interceptions, and converted crucial
shots. At halftime, SNG led 16-12.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, our girls stepped up their game, outscoring SNG
10-4 and taking a 22-20 lead heading into the final quarter.</p>
<p>The last quarter was an intense battle, with both teams matching each
other in attack and defense. As the final whistle blew, the score stood
at 26-26, sending the match into overtime.</p>
<p><strong>Clinching Victory in Overtime</strong>
<br>With the championship on the line, our girls dug deep, staying composed
under pressure. Their defense held strong, limiting SNG to just five shots,
while their attack delivered with precision, scoring 14 goals to secure
a 40-31 victory!</p>
<p><strong>A School-Wide Celebration</strong>
<br>The excitement wasn’t just on the court—back in school, the finals were
livestreamed, bringing together Sec 1 - 5 students &nbsp;and staff in the
school hall to cheer on the team. The electrifying atmosphere made it a
memorable end to Term 1!</p>
