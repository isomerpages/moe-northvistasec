<p>On Saturday, March 23, 2024, our students from the String Ensemble and
Symphonic Band were privileged to perform at One Punggol, Celebration Square
in support of World Down Syndrome Day. Experiencing the warm reception
and evident joy their performance brought to the audience was deeply touching.
We extend our sincere gratitude to the parents, teachers, students, and
alumni who graciously showed their support for our student performers at
this meaningful event.</p>
