**A Gritty Comeback for 3rd Place**

Our boys faced Yishun Town Secondary School (YTSS) once again in a thrilling battle for 3rd place. Having narrowly lost to YTSS in the quarter-finals (53-57 in overtime), they were eager for redemption. This time, the teams were evenly matched, ending regulation time in a draw. In a nail-biting overtime period, our boys fought hard and emerged victorious with an 86-82 win!

NSG North Zone C Division Boys Basketball Championship 

Our boys qualified for the finals of the NSG North Zone Basketball Championship after winning the game against Anderson Secondary in the semi-finals. The finals took place on Thursday, 27 July at 1.00pm at Singapore Basketball Centre. The boys faced a very strong team from Catholic High School (CHS). 

CHS started very well and built a commanding 13 – 32 lead at the end of first period. Cheered on by the supporters, our boys tried their best to get back into the game. They did not give up. Despite their best efforts, our boys lost the game 49 – 76. 

Congratulations to our boys for achieving 2nd placing in the North Zone Basketball Championship! We also thanked the supporters from 2E1, 2E4, 2N3 and Basketball CCA Boys for cheering for the team.
