Our students from the Symphonic Band participated in the Open Stage Competition at the above-mentioned event. The competition was held on Saturday, 8 July 2023 at Our Tampines Hub (OTH). 4 members from the String Ensemble CCA joined the band in the performance as well.  

The performance was well received by the audience and we were awarded “4-stars” by the judges. 

We thank the parents, alumni and students who went down OTH to cheer for our band.
