<h5><strong>B Division Football Championship</strong></h5>
<h5></h5>
<p>Our B Division Boys' football team had a remarkable season, achieving
qualification for League 1 in the NSG Football Championships. This marks
the first time our team has reached the highest level of competition, where
they faced off against the top football school teams nationwide.</p>
<p>Competing in a group alongside St Patrick’s Secondary School, Meridian
Secondary School, and Commonwealth Secondary School, our boys faced tough
challenges. Despite initial setbacks with losses in their first two games,
they rallied and secured a victory in their final match against Commonwealth
Secondary School.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our boys on their achievement of qualifying for League
1 in the NSG Football Championship. This accomplishment is a significant
milestone deserving of celebration.</p>
