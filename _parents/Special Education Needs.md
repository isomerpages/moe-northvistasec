### Special Education Needs

**MOE’s vision** is for all students in every school to experience an inclusive culture, one where

  

1 . Every Child can learn, and children with needs receive timely and appropriate support to achieve their full potential

  

2 . Every teacher is skillful to support and mange diverse learners, including students with SEN

  

3 . Every school has its own systematic whole-school approach to support diverse learners, including students with SEN
  

The school and the home are two of the most important systems for our students. When in sync, it brings about many positive students' outcomes in terms of academic, behavioural and emotional well-being. We are privileged to walk this journey with you as we work as a team to develop the student.


We have included resources which aim to provide parent/staff with information and self-help tools, to better support students with SEN.
