<p>At North Vista Secondary, the Service Learning Club is more than just
a CCA, it’s a movement of students who believe in making the world a kinder,
brighter, and greener place.</p>
<p>Our members are young changemakers who serve with heart. From reaching
out to the less fortunate to protecting the environment and caring for
animals, they roll up their sleeves and get involved where it matters most.</p>
<p>One of our flagship initiatives, Project <strong>READ</strong>, sees our
students partnering with Punggol Cove Primary School and the National Library
Board to mentor and guide younger students in their weekly reading journey,
nurturing not only literacy, but also confidence and a love for learning.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Service Learning Club activities span a wide spectrum
of meaningful experiences:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Kindness Projects that touch lives directly in our community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative advocacy, such as poetry-writing to spread values of compassion
and empathy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fundraising drives to support causes close to our hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands-on service with children, the elderly and green initiatives that
keep our environment thriving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every project, every act of service, is a step towards shaping Vistarians
of Character !</p>
<p>The Service Learning Club continues to spread love and kindness beyond
our school, reminding us all that when youth lead with compassion, they
can transform communities, inspire change, and build a better tomorrow.</p>
