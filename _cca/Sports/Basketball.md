<p>Basketball is a highly competitive and dynamic sport. In North Vista,
our Basketball Team is driven by the motto: “Train like Champions. Play
like Champions. Win like Champions.” We train to be physically fit as well
as mentally strong to overcome any challenges.</p>
<p>The Girls Team train on Mondays and Wednesdays and the Boys Team train
on Tuesdays and Fridays during the school term and with added intensity
during school holidays and competition periods. This ensures that the team
are well-prepared for any upcoming friendlies and competitions. The team
will continue to strive for excellence and uphold the good name of the
school. The journey together is amplified by the team’s belief: “Offence
wins Games. Defence wins Championships.”</p>
