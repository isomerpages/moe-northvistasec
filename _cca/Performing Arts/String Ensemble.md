Since its inception in 2005, String Ensemble has grown from strength to strength. Its gradual rise in membership has contributed to a wide range of audible and melodious music renditions. We have performed at important school functions and took part in a number of public performances.

North Vista String Ensemble was established for any student with interest and attitude to learn to play stringed musical instrument and have the opportunity to take part in ensemble performances. Over the years, we have welcomed many new learners into our violin, viola, cello and double bass sections. The ensemble takes pride in developing students into accomplished musicians.

Students who have a passion for music and are interested to learn an instrument are most welcomed to join the ensemble.
