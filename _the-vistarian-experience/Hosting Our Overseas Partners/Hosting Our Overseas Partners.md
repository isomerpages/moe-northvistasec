As North Vista positions itself as A School of Choice for Citizens of the future, harnessing the potential of international relations and partnerships has become an integral part of the Vistarian Experience. Our international partnerships reflect NVâ€™s mission to develop Vistarians who are able to appreciate and understand multiple social and cultural perspectives, and who will become world-ready individuals, sensitive to different cultures.  
  

Vistarians are given opportunities to travel on twinning, exchange or cultural immersion programmes at least once in his/her journey in NV. As much as we send students out into the world, we also bring the world to our doorstep, welcoming many international visitors to our school. Students are given the opportunity to play host and learn from their peers in other countries.
