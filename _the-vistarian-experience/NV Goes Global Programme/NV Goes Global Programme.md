With the emphasis on developing 21st Century Competencies (21CC) in our students and the recognition that schools’ internationalisation efforts can strongly support the Desired Outcomes of education, our school organizes various overseas trips to broaden our students’ experiences and deepen their learning.

  

**The objectives of North Vista’s NV goes Global programme are:**  

*    To develop Vistarians to be an aware and sensitive towards cultural differences
*    To instil in Vistarians a sense of commitment and rootedness to be Singaporean
*    To provide an opportunity for Vistarians to learn and interact with their peers in exchange programmes

  

Travelling overseas to visit our friends in other ASEAN member countries gives students the opportunity to make international friends and expose them to different cultures and lifestyles. Besides travelling abroad, we also host our foreign friends in Singapore.
