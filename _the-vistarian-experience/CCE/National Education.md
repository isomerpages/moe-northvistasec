National Education (NE) was launched in 1997. It aims to provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political context, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.  

Current local and global trends have the potential to influence how our students perceive and understand issues that impact Singapore:

*   Changing Demographics
*   Evolving Socio-Political Climate
*   Accelerating Disruptions

NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. The following key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore shape the purpose and approach to NE:

*   A Sense of Belonging
*   A Sense of Reality
*   A Sense of Hope
*    A Will to Act

**A few of the highlights of NE curriculum at NV in year 2020 are as described below:**

  

### Total Defence Day

The school commemorated Total Defence Day on 14 February 2020. The theme for this year’s Total Defence campaign is ‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’, focusing on the many ways we can put Total Defence in action in our everyday lives.


To understand the pillars of Total Defence, members from the school uniformed groups shared on various activities that they have carried out in contributing to the different pillars of Total Defence.

Students were engaged in different activities conducted by their peers in teaching them how they can put Total Defence in action in their daily lives. While the students in class had the opportunity to learn and gain valuable skills that can contribute to the society, the students from the Uniformed Groups involved gained the opportunity to interact and share knowledge with their peers from different classes.

### International Friendship Day

‘Beyond Borders’ was the theme for International Friendship Day 2020. This year, the school commemorated IFD on 3 April 2020.

IFD took place in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic this year, Due to this, IFD mainly focused on how Singapore’s interconnectedness to other countries, especially ASEAN countries, had an impact on our local COVID-19 situation.

In class, students gained a deeper understanding on the impact COVID-19 has on various countries such as Japan, New York and Italy. Besides that, they also saw how the impact of the pandemic on other countries also affected Singapore in various aspects.

In line with IFD, students think of ways on how they, as a teenager, are able to reach out to those affected by the pandemic, given some of the local examples provided in the ST IN issue.  
  

### Racial Harmony Day

On 17 July 2020, the school commemorated Racial Harmony Day. The theme for RHD this year was ‘Multicultural Singapore’, which focused on understanding the key to harmony.

On that day, the students reflect on the objective and importance of Racial Harmony Day in Singapore. In class, students were engaged in discussions on their experiences with racism and expressing their thoughts on what they understand from the term ‘racism’. A video screening of a documentary entitled ‘Kids & Racism: Regardless of Race’ highlighted what racism means to the different races in Singapore.

For the upper secondary cohort, they were engaged in more in-depth discussions as they discussed on case studies that happened locally such as the E-pay ‘Brownface’ advertisement. The students also exchanged their views on how the COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated racial tension in different parts of the world.

By the end of the lesson, students understood the importance of being sensitive with our words and actions to respect people of different races.

### National Day

Unlike previous years where the whole school celebrated National Day with a parade followed by a carnival, this year, National Day was celebrated through a digital platform.

Due to the impact of COVID-19, students explored a new way to observe the flag-raising ceremony that was screened via Youtube LIVE from the comfort of their own classrooms. In view of the current pandemic situation, this year’s National Day theme, Together A Stronger Singapore, served as a call to rally Singaporeans to play our part to push forward and determine Singapore’s future, in spite of the difficulties and crises. Despite commemorating the nation’s birthday in class, it was a meaningful celebration where students developed a deeper understanding of who they are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.

The post-parade segment showcased stories of young Singaporeans who have found ways to give back to the community, especially those badly affected by COVID-19. The school CCA leaders also shared on how they, as students, can emerge stronger together from this pandemic.

### Anthem Moment

National Day 2020 was indeed a memorable event for the school as North Vista Secondary School became the only school in Singapore to be selected for the Anthem Moment, representing the education sector. Several ministers visited the school to witness the flag-raising ceremony on 9 August 2020. A few of our students also had the opportunity to interact with the ministers and members of parliament.

### Values in Action (VIA at NV)

The NV VIA programme follows a progressive and structured approach, through infusion in IP curriculum and customisation based on students’ needs, to nurture Vistarians who exemplify school values within and beyond school.

a.     Infusion in IP Curriculum - focusing on creating an impact on the community around the students, the students are provided with guidance from subject teachers to extend their learning in IP subjects such as Literature and Social Studies beyond the classroom. Such inter-department collaboration also helps to bridge classroom teaching with real world problem solving using design thinking skills.

b.     Customisation based on both students’ readiness and beneficiaries’ needs in upper sec VIA – In order to encourage students to take ownership in demonstrating the school values beyond classroom, class student leaders are empowered to lead their classmates to make informed decisions on the various community beneficiaries to serve, through leveraging on data gathered from Social Studies Issue Investigation. Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place, the students adopt the model of Indirect VIA to ensure the continuity of service learning. For example, the students created care packs for over 3000 workers in Punggol and Tuas Dormitories. Another group of students also created hand sanitisers for the entire school population.
