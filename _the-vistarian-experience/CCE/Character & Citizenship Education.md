<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) at North Vista Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>At North Vista Secondary, our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
programme aims to nurture <strong>Vistarians of Character</strong> through
holistic and values-driven learning experiences. Guided by the CCE Curriculum
Framework, we seek to instil our school values of <strong>Care, Resilience, Respect, and Responsibility</strong> through
meaningful and engaging programmes across students’ school experiences.</p>
<p>Students experience CCE through weekly lessons, student development experiences,
IP subjects, and opportunities for strong <strong>Teacher–Student Relationships</strong>.
Together, these efforts help nurture students who learn with purpose, strive
with resilience, and contribute actively to a better future.</p>
<p>We adopt a <strong>whole-school approach</strong> to CCE, where every staff
member plays a part in shaping students’ character through daily interactions.
Professional development equips our teachers with facilitation and reflective
skills to encourage student voice and empower sound decision-making — strengthening
students’ <strong>social and emotional competencies</strong>.</p>
<p>To affirm positive values, the school recognizes exemplary students through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

the values of Care, Respect, Discipline, and Enterprise.</p>
