### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum in NV aims to develop Vistarians of Character through the provision of holistic experiences in the affective domains. Taking reference from the CCE Curriculum Frame, we strive to inculcate our school values of Care, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility through the provision of pervasive, meaningful and engaging activities across a wide spectrum of student experiences.

This includes the weekly CCE lessons, key student development experiences, IP subjects and opportunities created for establishing Teacher‐Student Relationship. All these aims to nurture Vistarians of Character who learn, strive and
contribute for a better future.

We adopt a whole‐school approach to CCE, based on the fundamental belief that every staff member is responsible for developing the character of our students through our daily interactions with them. Professional development helped
equip every teacher with the knowledge and skills to facilitate discussions and reflections. This helps to promote students’ voices and empower students to make sound decisions, strengthening Social‐emotional competencies.

It is important to affirm students who display strong character and positive values. Hence, the school recognises students’ good behaviour through the school‐based Values Ambassador Award (VAA) and MOE Edusave Character
Award (ECHA). The VAA is given to deserving students who espouse the school values of Care, Respect, Discipline and Enterprise and who have good character. Likewise, the ECHA aims to recognise students who are role models in their
conduct or who have demonstrated strong values. In addition to this, the NV STAR Programme aims to also recognize students who display the school values.

**Education &amp; Career Guidance**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) plays an integral part in student development at North Vista Secondary School.

Outcomes

The ECG curriculum at NV aims to achieve the following learning outcomes:

1. Understand the importance of achievements, participation and non‐academic involvement in school.
2. Nurture one’s self‐awareness, self‐directedness and life skills to set wise goals.
3. Explore career interest and match it to prospective jobs. Plan the education pathway to attain the choice of career.
4. Inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well‐functioning of society.
5. Equip the students to make responsible decisions regarding post‐secondary education and engage career stakeholders.

To support Vistarians in making responsible decisions to achieving their goals and aspirations, the school provides various platforms to enrich and empower them.

**Career Seminar**

Career Seminar seeks to provide participants with insights into the world of work, create opportunities for them to engage with professionals from various industries and fields, in a bid to increase their awareness of the tenets of
different professions and industries. Through this, graduating students gain insights from professionals from different industries and learn more about the tertiary education courses of their choice. We also invited speakers from various
diverse fields including Deejay’s from 987 FM to inspire students on possible career opportunities.
