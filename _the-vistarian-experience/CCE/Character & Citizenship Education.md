### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum in NV aims to develop Vistarians of Character through the provision of holistic experiences in the affective domains. Taking reference from the CCE Curriculum Frame, we strive to inculcate our school values of Care, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility through the provision of pervasive, meaningful and engaging activities across a wide spectrum of student experiences.

This includes the weekly CCE lessons, key student development experiences, IP subjects and opportunities created for establishing Teacher‐Student Relationship. All these aims to nurture Vistarians of Character who learn, strive and
contribute for a better future.

We adopt a whole‐school approach to CCE, based on the fundamental belief that every staff member is responsible for developing the character of our students through our daily interactions with them. Professional development helped
equip every teacher with the knowledge and skills to facilitate discussions and reflections. This helps to promote students’ voices and empower students to make sound decisions, strengthening Social‐emotional competencies.

It is important to affirm students who display strong character and positive values. Hence, the school recognises students’ good behaviour through the school‐based Values Ambassador Award (VAA) and MOE Edusave Character
Award (ECHA). The VAA is given to deserving students who espouse the school values of Care, Respect, Discipline and Enterprise and who have good character. Likewise, the ECHA aims to recognise students who are role models in their
conduct or who have demonstrated strong values. In addition to this, the NV STAR Programme aims to also recognize students who display the school values.
