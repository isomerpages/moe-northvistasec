The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum in NV aims to develop Vistarians of Character through the provision of holistic experiences in the affective domains. Taking reference from the CCE Curriculum Frame (Figure 1), we strive to inculcate our school values of Care, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility through the provision of pervasive, meaningful and engaging activities across a wide spectrum of student experiences.  
  
This includes the weekly CCE lessons, key student development experiences, IP subjects and opportunities created for establishing Teacher-Student rapport.  All these aims to nurture Vistarians of Character who learn, strive and contribute for a better future.

We adopt a whole-school approach to CCE, based on the fundamental belief that every staff member is responsible for developing the character of our students through our daily interactions with them. Professional development helped equip every teacher with the knowledge and skills to facilitate discussions and reflections. This helps to promote students’ voices and empower students to make sound decisions, strengthening Social-emotional competencies.

It is important to affirm students who display strong character and positive values. Hence, the school recognises students’ good behaviour through the school-based Values Ambassador Award (VAA) and MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA). The VAA is given to deserving students who espouse the school values of Care, Respect, Discipline and Enterprise and who have good character. Likewise, the ECHA aims to recognise students who are role models in their conduct or who have demonstrated strong values.

### Education & Career Guidance

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) plays an integral part in student development at North Vista Secondary School.

**Outcomes**

The ECG curriculum at NV aims to achieve the following learning outcomes:

1.       Understand the importance of achievements, participation and non-academic involvement in school.

2.       Nurture one’s self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills to set wise goals.

3.       Explore career interest and match it to prospective jobs. Plan the education pathway to attain the choice of career.

4.       Inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well-functioning of society.

5.       Equip the students to make responsible decisions regarding post-secondary education and engage career stakeholders.

To support Vistarians in making responsible decisions to achieving their goals and aspirations, the school provides various platforms to enrich and empower them.

**Career Seminar**  

Career Seminar seeks to provide participants with insights into the world of work, create opportunities for them to engage with professionals from various industries and fields, in a bid to increase their awareness of the tenets of different professions and industries. Through this, graduating students gain insights from professionals from different industries and learn more about the tertiary education courses of their choice.  

**Work Experience**

Before Covid-19, a key feature of the ECG curriculum at NV is the Work Experience Programme. Secondary Three students are attached to well-established organisations for a short stint of work experience. The objective of the program is to instill the importance of appropriate work ethics and conduct while increasing their awareness about a selected industry and/or area of work. We hope to re-establish this programme for our students in the near future.  

  

**Elective Modules**

The main focus of elective modules is to give students valuable exposure and information on their choice of industry. The modules aim to affirm their interest or broaden their career choices and opportunities. At the end of the workshop, students develop a realistic outlook in terms of career prospects which enables them to choose education pathway wisely. This year, we piloted the Applied Learning Modules (ApLM) with Sec 3 NA & NT students involved in a 3-day workshop in ITE and Singapore Polytechnic. Our students learnt valuable skills in IT, Engineering and Business domains.  

**Counselling**  

Our ECG Counsellor, Miss Pan Miaohua, supports students (individually or in small groups) with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed decisions for a smoother transition to further education or work. She also shared with parents during the Sec 2 Streaming Webinar and worked extensively with our students for Direct-School Admission for JC and Early Admission Exercise for both Polytechnic and ITE education.

### Cyber Wellness at NV

Social networking sites, online games, video-sharing sites and devices such as mobile phones and tablets are now common fixtures in our students’ lives. In Singapore, by the age of fifteen, most youths are connected online via their smart phones.

The digital lifestyle and the evolving nature of social media have also given rise to a set of emerging and complex issues that can have an adverse impact on our students' well-being.  

**Outcomes**  

Cyber Wellness programme at NV aims to nurture our students to develop a strong, resilient and positive identity in the online world that is reflective of their real life persona. This is achieved through building healthy relationships, both in the real and virtual world, and by making correct choices in their online interactions and decision making.

The guiding principles in the curriculum design are:

1.       Keep students updated on the latest news and developments relating to Cyber Wellness issues

2.       Encourages students to make informed choices

Cultivate healthy and positive habits that enrich their online experiences

**Topics of Cyber Wellness**  

*   Cyber Use
*   Cyber Identity
*   Cyber Relationships
*   Cyber Citizenship
*   Cyber Ethics

  

### Moments@NV 2021

On a more regular basis, our staff and students are given an opportunity to share their thoughts on character development with the entire school through pre-recorded videos during morning FTGP. Form-Teachers would then guide their students through a series of reflection questions that aims to deepen their understanding of the topic shared. 

  

Brief reflections by staff and students on character development, Values-in-Action initiatives, cyber-wellness as well as other aspects of school experience allow key messages on values and character development to be communicated at a school-wide platform.
