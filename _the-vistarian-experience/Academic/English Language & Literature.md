The English Language and Literature Department aims to equip our students with 21st century critical thinking and effective communication skills, to prepare them for an unprecedented future. Specifically, we envision Vistarians as self-directed learners, empathetic communicators and discerning readers.

### English Language

Our curriculum comprises thematic and skills-based units, using multi-modal texts that enable students to deepen their content understanding and hone their linguistic skills. We aim to cultivate the joy of reading through diverse materials that appeal to the varying abilities of our learners. The EL Department also adopts MOE’s CLEARR pedagogical framework in our lesson design.

Through external partnerships and nationwide competitions (e.g. Live On Festival and Plain English Speaking Awards), we actively create opportunities for Vistarians to develop their competency collaboratively through authentic experiences. In 2023, Hillary Wee and Chang Ivory, both from 3E3, were awarded the High Distinction award in the Senior Essay Writing Category of the Live On Festival.

### Literature in English &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

In the Literature classroom, opportunities are provided for students to read and respond to a variety of literary texts (prose, poetry and drama), as well as to engage with diverse themes on a more personal level. During lessons, students are conditioned to engage in an intellectual discourse on their analysis of their texts. 

The texts offered in the Academic Year 2024 are as follows:

Beyond the classroom, learning journeys are organised for lower secondary students to view theatre performances based on Literature texts. Students with an aptitude and passion for Literature are also selected to participate in competitions such as the National Schools Literature Festival and Unity Writer’s Festival, to further enrich their learning of the subject.
