### English Language

The school-based curriculum is designed to include both thematic and skills-based units, enabling students to deepen their content understanding and hone their linguistic skills. Through this and other school-based programmes, we create opportunities for Vistarians to develop competence in thinking and reading critically, as well as communicating confidently and empathetically in the English Language.

### Literature in English                    

In the Literature classroom, opportunities are provided for students to read and respond to a variety of literary texts (prose, poetry and drama), as well as to explore different perspectives and give personal responses to different themes.

The texts offered from Academic Year 2021 are as follows:
