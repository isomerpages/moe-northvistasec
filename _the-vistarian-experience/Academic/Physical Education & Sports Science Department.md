### Physical Education & Sports Science Department

North Vista Secondary School’s PE and Sports Science Department continues to pride itself on a holistic curriculum that aims to inculcate the importance of a healthy and active lifestyle to all Vistarians. Physical Education is shared with the students based on the pillars of Rigour, Relevance and Reflective Learning. Our curriculum and programmes were designed to Engage, Excite and Enrich students, as we worked towards the ultimate goal of teaching them good values through sports and games.  

In line with the revised PE curriculum, our Department continued to plan 12 to 16 hours of engaging and affective learning for each sport that the students learnt. Besides the usual staple of Athletics, Netball, Football, Badminton and Basketball, students also tried newer sports like Ultimate Frisbee, Floorball, Tchoukball and Tag Rugby. On top of that, students had the opportunity to create games and also learn disability sports like Goalball and Seated Volleyball. Some of these sports that the students learnt would culminate in an inter class game, so that students get the opportunity to display their values of friendship, respect and excellence that they have learnt through their journey of learning the sport.

For Outdoor Education, students tried their hand at orienteering and outdoor cooking skills, in preparation for their adventure camps during their time in school. Fitness training continued to take on new dimensions, with progressive training being key in their NAPFA preparation, and more game-based functional fitness embedded in their sporting drills.

  

The Vistarian Road Run is an annual sports event that promises and delivers opportunities for competition, fun, fitness and camaraderie.

**Exercise and Sports Science (ESS - 6081)**  

Our school offers the O’ Level subject of Exercise and Sports Science as an Elective subject since its inception in 2018. The course aims to impart basic sports science knowledge and physical skills in two physical activities (one individual and one team sport) to students who are interested in learning about human movement and sports.

To make learning authentic, the ESS students are given the opportunity to organize and participate in the annual NV PE & SS Conference held for ESS students in Singapore. They also have the opportunity to compete at various sporting events such as Combined Schools Meet and N1 Cluster Games to hone their skills through competitions.

**6th NV PE & SS Conference**

The NV PE & SS Conference is an annual event which brings all the ESS students in Singapore together for an afternoon of learning and activities. Each cohort of ESS students run the conference entirely on their own and ensure the success of the conference by being good hosts to our guests from other schools.
