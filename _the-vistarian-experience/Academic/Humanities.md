The Humanities department aims to provide student-centric, values driven education based on key Humanities principles of critical thinking, empathy and sense of inquiry. We hope that through the Humanities programme in North Vista Secondary, we will be able to engage students with experiential and authentic learning experiences through which they will acquire knowledge and life skills. We also aim to empower students to be positive young leaders with the ability to lead themselves and people around them and in turn enrich our community through our students who will contribute as active and responsible citizens.  

Through varied level programmes, our teachers aim to make History, Geography and Social Studies come alive in our classrooms. In turn, Vistarians make connections with what they have learnt in class and attempt to relate to real-life examples or case studies.

History
---------

History lessons are inquiry based in nature. Lower secondary students are given the tools and lenses they need to discover the world and its past. As part of the experiential based learning experience, our students will also get to visit the National Museum and embark on the Artefactually Speaking Guided Tour.

To enhance their learning experience, lower secondary students enjoy live and interactive Historical Investigation lessons via the Historical exploration Google Site created by their very own teachers. Students also enjoy source analysis through authentic historical artefacts.

Upper secondary History students continue to see History come alive in their classroom where they enjoy Google Earth Tours of key historical sites. Students also enjoy further experiential learning by participating in the Istana Heritage Challenge and National History Challenge. Students with outstanding results were selected for the NUS Talent Development programme. The following students were shortlisted for the programme:

* Ruiz Diego (2022)
* Ryan Seah (2023)
