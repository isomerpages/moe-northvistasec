<h4><strong>Geography</strong></h4>
<p>Geography at NV are designed to cultivate curious and critical thinkers
who can understand and engage with our complex world. Our approach centres
on inquiry-based learning, where students explore geographical concepts
through 'big ideas' and real-world investigations. Through structured questioning
techniques and formative assessment strategies, our teachers guide students
to construct their own understanding whilst developing essential 21st-century
skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Technology-Enhanced Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>We integrate cutting-edge technology to make geographical concepts tangible
and engaging. Using collaborative digital platforms like Padlet and Google
Sites, students work together to collect data, analyse patterns, and present
their findings on topics ranging from sustainable housing to urban development.
Virtual reality experiences transport students to different global locations,
bringing distant places directly into our classrooms and enriching their
geographical understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Geographical Investigations</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our comprehensive Geographical Investigation programme spans all five
stages of inquiry, allowing students to experience authentic geographical
research from hypothesis formation to conclusion. From Secondary 1 to 4,
students explore diverse topics including water management, housing sustainability,
tourism impacts, and ecosystem services. These investigations develop students'
analytical and research skills whilst connecting classroom learning to
real-world geographical challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Beyond the Classroom</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Geography learning extends beyond our school walls through carefully planned
learning journeys to key institutions such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority
(URA) and the Science Centre. These experiences provide students with firsthand
exposure to urban planning processes and scientific applications in Geography,
reinforcing classroom concepts through authentic, real-world contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Competitions and Achievements</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Geography students regularly excel in national competitions, demonstrating
their analytical thinking and geographical expertise across various platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Earth Alive Inter-School Challenge</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Organised by NTU's Earth Observatory of Singapore and Science Centre Singapore,
this competition focuses on geological hazards and climate resilience.
The four NV teams comprising of 16 Secondary 3 and 4 students participated
in challenges involving case studies on how countries can remain resilient
to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and tsunamis in a changing
climate. This further broadened their understanding of physical geography
and environmental challenges.</p>

<p></p>
<p>These competitions provide valuable platforms for students to apply their
geographical knowledge, develop presentation skills, and network with peers
from other schools whilst fostering a deeper appreciation for the subject.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>National Gallery Visit for Secondary 2 Cohort: Museum-Based Learning Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Through a partnership between the CCE and Humanities departments, students
participated in Museum-Based Learning visits to the National Museum of
Singapore and the Changi Chapel and Museum. These visits allowed students
to connect history with character development, exploring Singapore’s journey
as a nation and reflecting on values such as resilience, unity, and active
citizenship.</p>
<p>At the National Museum, students engaged with exhibits highlighting key
moments in Singapore’s history, linking them to nation-building and shared
identity. The Changi Chapel and Museum offered a personal perspective on
hardship during the Japanese Occupation, helping students appreciate courage
and empathy.</p>
<p>By combining historical inquiry and moral reflection, the programme strengthened
students’ understanding of Singapore’s heritage and nurtured them as thoughtful,
responsible citizens.</p>
<p><strong><u>Lower Secondary Historical Investigation Project</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Historical Investigation (HI) project for Secondary 1 and 2 students
is an integral part of Singapore’s History curriculum, aimed at nurturing
critical thinking and inquiry skills. Through this project, students actively
explore historical events or issues by analyzing sources, collecting evidence,
and drawing their own conclusions.</p>
<p>Students collaborate in groups to research specific historical topics,
often focusing on Singapore’s history or significant global events. They
are guided to pose thoughtful questions, assess primary and secondary sources,
and consider multiple perspectives before presenting their findings.</p>
<p>This hands-on approach helps students develop key historical skills, including
source evaluation, evidence-based reasoning, and argument construction.
It also fosters an understanding of how history shapes societal values,
while promoting collaboration, effective communication, and independent
learning.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the HI project deepens students’ appreciation of history as
an investigative discipline and equips them with critical skills that are
valuable across other subjects and in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>which student interviewers collect personal stories from senior interviewees
about becoming a Singapore citizen between the 1950s and 1960s. Slated
to open in 2028, the Founders’ Memorial will honour Singapore's founding
generation and other key figures who shaped the nation's path to independence
and early development.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>MOE History Challenge</u></strong>
</p>
<p>History Challenge is a national competition aimed to promote a deeper
interest in history among students. It encourages participants to explore
and critically engage with historical events, figures, and themes beyond
their textbooks. This challenge aims to develop historical thinking skills
such as analyzing sources, forming evidence-based arguments, and understanding
multiple perspectives of historical narratives.</p>
<p>Through various stages, including quizzes, essays, and projects, students
demonstrate their knowledge of both local and global history. The challenge
fosters a deeper appreciation for the relevance of history in shaping today's
society and encourages students to reflect on how historical events influence
current issues. By participating, students also develop important values
such as critical thinking, resilience, and intellectual curiosity.</p>

<h4><strong>Social Studies</strong></h4>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum seeks to nurture students into informed,
concerned, and active citizens who contribute positively to society. It
prepares them to understand Singapore’s place in an increasingly interconnected
world and to appreciate the complexities of the human experience.</p>
<p>By engaging with topics that are relevant and meaningful, students explore
real-world issues that shape their lives and communities. Through guided
inquiry, they develop curiosity, acquire essential knowledge, and strengthen
their ability to think critically and reflectively.</p>
<p><strong><u>Model ASEAN 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Model ASEAN is a simulation-based educational program designed for students
to learn about the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In this
program:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students role-play as delegates representing different ASEAN member countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They discuss, debate, and negotiate on regional issues such as trade,
climate change, security, and human rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants research their assigned country’s policies, perspectives,
and interests to represent it accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program helps students develop diplomacy, communication, critical
thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.</p>
</li>
