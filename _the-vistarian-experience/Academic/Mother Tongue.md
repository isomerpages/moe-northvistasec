### Malay Language

The Malay Language Unit designs an engaging and meaningful curriculum that focuses on providing real world and authentic experience for students to learn the language. As such, our academic outline and enrichment programmes aim to educate and empower students to create their own learning experience in acquiring language skills and cultural exposure. Our various types of enrichment programmes enable students to ‘read the word and the world’.

  

Through the learning of the language, we also aim to equip students with the relevant skills and knowledge needed to adapt to the changing needs of the society. In addition, participation in language-related competitions and engagement with the community hopes to nurture our students to be critical readers, creative writers and reflective thinkers.

*   Enrichment Programmes
*   Internal and external competitions
