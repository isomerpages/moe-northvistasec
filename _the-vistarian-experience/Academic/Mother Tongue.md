### Chinese Language

The Chinese Language Unit aims to develop students’ passion and interests in Chinese Language. With the goal of helping every student to achieve the highest proficiency levels of Chinese Language, we adopt various teaching methodologies to cater to the different needs of our students. We provide vibrant and effective teaching to enhance the students’ communication skills and inculcate their cultural awareness and appreciation. 

We organise various exciting and enriching programmes to engage our students in the learning of Chinese Language. These programmes include Cultural Language Camp, Mother Tongue Fortnight, Learning Journey, Author-in-Residence Programme (Reading and Writing), Cultural Performance and Exposure, Conversational Chinese and Malay(CCM), School-wide Reading Programme and Language or Cultural Competitions. The Chinese Language Unit also seeks to preserve our traditions and core values and thus maintain our leading position in the competitive world.
