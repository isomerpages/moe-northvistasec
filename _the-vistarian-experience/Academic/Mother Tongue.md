<h3>Malay Language</h3>
<p>The Malay Language Unit designs an engaging and meaningful curriculum
that focuses on providing real world and authentic experience for students
to learn the language. As such, our academic outline and enrichment programmes
aim to educate and empower students to create their own learning experience
in acquiring language skills and cultural exposure. Our various types of
enrichment programmes enable students to ‘read the word and the world’.</p>
<p>Through the learning of the language, we also aim to equip students with
the relevant skills and knowledge needed to adapt to the changing needs
of the society. In addition, participation in language-related competitions
and engagement with the community hopes to nurture our students to be critical
readers, creative writers and reflective thinkers.</p>
