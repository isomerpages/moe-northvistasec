In NV, we want our students to be excited about learning Mathematics.

The NV mathematics curriculum recognises the diverse learning needs of our students and&nbsp;we have a fundamental&nbsp;belief that all students can learn mathematics.

We want our students to understand Mathematics on a deeper level and become competent problem solvers who can appreciate how Mathematics is applied in the real world.

Students will be guided to make detailed observations and analyse evidence by examining real world data derived from a variety of contexts and interpret the data collected using sound mathematical principles.

**Mathematics Trail**  

To nurture the joy of learning, the Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic) students will take part in the annual Mathematics Trail, organized by our teachers where students use their creative thinking skills to solve real world problems at different stations. Through this activity, the students get to experience the relevance of Mathematics around them and work together as a team. This will complement classroom lessons to further enhance their learning.

**Singapore Mathematical Olympiad Training &amp; Competition**

As part of our Talent Development Programme, a 10-week Math Olympiad Training will be organized for a selected group of Secondary Two Express students. This training programme aims to develop in our students’ higher-order problem solving skills which include non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.

We are pleased to announce the achievements by the following students:
