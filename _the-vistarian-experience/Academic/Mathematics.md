<h4><strong>Mathematics Department</strong></h4>
<p>In NV, we want our students to be excited about learning Mathematics.</p>
<p>The NV mathematics curriculum recognises the diverse learning needs of
our students and&nbsp;we have a fundamental&nbsp;belief that all students
can learn mathematics.</p>
<p>We want our students to understand Mathematics on a deeper level and become
competent problem solvers who can appreciate how Mathematics is applied
in the real world.</p>
<p>Students will be guided to make detailed observations and analyse evidence
by examining real world data derived from a variety of contexts and interpret
the data collected using sound mathematical principles.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Trail</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To nurture the joy of learning, the Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic)
students will take part in the annual Mathematics Trail, organized by our
teachers where students use their creative thinking skills to solve real
world problems at different stations. Through this activity, the students
get to experience the relevance of Mathematics around them and work together
as a team. This will complement classroom lessons to further enhance their
learning.</p>
