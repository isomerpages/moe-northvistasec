In NV, we want our students to be excited about learning Mathematics.

The NV mathematics curriculum recognises the diverse learning needs of our students and we have a fundamental belief that all students can learn mathematics.

We want our students to understand Mathematics on a deeper level and become competent problem solvers who can appreciate how Mathematics is applied in the real world.

Students will be guided to make detailed observations and analyse evidence by examining real world data derived from a variety of contexts and interpret the data collected using sound mathematical principles.
