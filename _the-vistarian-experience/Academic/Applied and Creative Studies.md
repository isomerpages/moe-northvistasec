<p><strong>Applied &amp; Creative Studies Department</strong>
</p>
<p>The Creative Studies consists of Fine Arts, Design &amp; Technology and
Food &amp; Consumer Education. We offer Vistarians a myriad of possibilities
and opportunities to develop their creativity in Aesthetics, Design, Food
Science and Consumerism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to develop every Vistarian as a creative and confident person,
possessing visual literacy which enables him or her to observe the ever-changing
environment with increased awareness and aesthetic sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also encourage Vistarians to Perceive, Communicate and Appreciate the
Arts and Design. Our mission is to Enable, Engage and Empower our students.
The Creative Studies provides Vistarians with 3 authentic experiences in
their course of studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>They are:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The NV Arts Experience</h3>
<p>The NV Visual Arts Experience is designed to allow students to have a
meaningful learning experience, where they are exposed to a variety of
art forms in the real world and to try their hand at creating a piece of
work that they may call their own.</p>
<p>The Arts Enrichment programme in North Vista Secondary engages each student
by taking them on exciting customised learning journeys to art museums
and galleries to cultivate their appreciation of the arts. These programmes
are selectively tailored to give students a better understanding of the
ways which modern art communicates the ideas behind works. Through the
exposure and knowledge of new artists, the NV art department hopes that
students will be inspired and motivated to create something meaningful
for themselves.</p>

<p>Design and technology is the study of the production of man-made objects
to solve real human needs. The production of these objects is carried out
through the creative disciplined strategy called the design thinking process
that focuses on user empathy and stretches the student imagination to the
fullest. D&amp;T provides an exciting platform for student to define the
scope of their project based on a given theme. They are then guided to
ideate, develop and finally construct a prototype.</p>
<p>Technological areas of Electronics, Mechanisms and Structures are also
incorporated into the design where necessary. To further enrich the learning
experience, the students go on learning journeys to provide them with unique
learning experience from different perspective. Students also take part
in design competitions organised by polytechnics to apply what they have
learnt in the real world. D&amp;T is dynamic and challenges the curiosity
of the student to find out what might be better solutions for human needs.</p>
<p>It trains the confidence of student to venture into the unknown. The curriculum
of Design and technology aims to develop students as self-directed learners,
concerned citizens as well as active contributors to the fast changing
world.</p>
<h3>The NV Food and Consumer Education Experience</h3>
<p>The aim of the Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) is to empower students
to take responsibility in making choices and decisions about health and
daily needs. Food science experiments, culinary practical sessions as well
as student-directed learning via the internet are ways which students gain
knowledge and develop new ideas in the coursework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 21st Century Skills such as the critical thinking skills, analytical
skills and decision-making skills are also developed in our students as
they work through their coursework. This hands-on approach, which the teachers
adopt, allows students to relate and apply the knowledge gained in real-life
situations.</p>
