The Science department aims to nurture our students to have a lifelong passion for Science through student-centred activities that promote scientific thought and academic excellence. Guided by MOE’s Revised Science Curriculum Framework, our Science teachers design and implement lessons so that students experience Science through the three Ins – Inspire, Inquire and Innovate. Through skill development in scientific experimentation, critical thinking and problem-solving, our students will grow to be confident citizens of the 21st Century who possess a deep understanding of scientific ideas and are able to tackle Science-related problems, and communicate scientific ideas with confidence and clarity. 

### Engaging, Exciting &amp; Enriching Science Experiences in Classrooms

Our curriculum is designed to Engage, Excite and Enrich students’ learning. These learning experiences are conducted in and beyond the classrooms and Science laboratories. Various teaching strategies are used to cater to the varying needs of students. Student learning is carefully monitored by our team of dedicated teachers, and gaps in learning are closed in a timely manner so that students can advance in their learning.

### Highlights of Programmes

**Support School’s Farm to Table Applied Learning Programme**

Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides students differentiated, experiential and authentic learning experiences that guide students to explore and apply scientific reasoning, methodologies and theories in their daily lives. Through these experiences, we strive to develop them into Vistarians who are inquisitive and innovative individuals.

**Experiential Learning at Learning Journeys**  

Students are provided opportunities to embark on Science Learning Journeys to witness the Science learned in their classrooms come alive in the real world. This allows students deepen their Science knowledge and build connections between their knowledge with the world around them.
