In line with MOE’s EdTech Masterplan to nurture “Transform Education through Technology”, the ICT Department supports all Instructional Programme (IP) departments in providing quality learning in support of the total curriculum.

We continuously invest in our Vistarians through meaningful and intentional use of education technology. We aim to provide our Vistarians with easy access to technology and develop their digital literacy to allow them to have quality learning anytime and anywhere.

As numerous enhanced infrastructures that support teaching and learning through the use of education technology are continuously put in place, our teachers also go through professional development to become technologically-adept, collaborative learning designers.

Specific strategies to bring about deeper integration of ICT into the Curriculum, Assessment and Pedagogy are as follows: 

1.	Provide quality online learning resources for students
2.	Incorporate ICT in Assessment
3.	Deepen Digital Learning: Cyber Wellness and Digital Literacy

Besides harnessing technology for collaborating, learning and increasing productivity, we also advocate positive use of technology for the good of the community. This involves an understanding of Vistarians’ online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. While navigating cyberspace, Vistarians are expected to demonstrate respect for self and others and practice safe and responsible use.
