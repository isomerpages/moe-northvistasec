The aims of Life Long Learning Programme is to provide students with authentic and meaningful experiences to develop values and 21 CC. The Life Long Learning Programme in NV is designed in alignment to our School Vision - Vistarians of Character who learn, strive and contribute for a better future.  
  
Through the platforms of photography and videography, students will appreciate different perspectives, learn communication skills, and empathise with others through creative and inventive thinking. We strive to provide opportunities to help students deepen their skills in photography and videography, thereafter contribute in the production of Storyboard/Videos/Short-films that will help to promote school values.

**Poem : Let's Respect Mother Earth together**

Let us all do our part to save the Earth <br>
Together we shall help each other! <br>
When we see litter<br>
Let’s pick it up and let the floor shine like glitter<br>
Come on everyone,<br>
Let’s do our part to show some respect for Mother Earth!<br>
Clean up after yourself, be responsible<br>
If you don’t, the mess will be as smelly as a skunk<br>
Let us all show respect to the cleaners<br>
As they do their best to make the world a better place<br>
We only have Mother Earth to call our own<br>
Let’s be responsible!<br>
Let’s slow down global warming<br>
To save the artic animals<br>
Let’s all respect Mother Earth!<br>
