The aims of Life Long Learning Programme is to provide students with authentic and meaningful experiences to develop values and 21 CC. The Life Long Learning Programme in NV is designed in alignment to our School Vision - Vistarians of Character who learn, strive and contribute for a better future.  
  
Through the platforms of photography and videography, students will appreciate different perspectives, learn communication skills, and empathise with others through creative and inventive thinking. We strive to provide opportunities to help students deepen their skills in photography and videography, thereafter contribute in the production of Storyboard/Videos/Short-films that will help to promote school values.

**Poem : Let's Respect Mother Earth together**

Let us all do our part to save the Earth <br>
Together we shall help each other! <br>
When we see litter<br>
Let’s pick it up and let the floor shine like glitter<br>
Come on everyone,<br>
Let’s do our part to show some respect for Mother Earth!<br>
Clean up after yourself, be responsible<br>
If you don’t, the mess will be as smelly as a skunk<br>
Let us all show respect to the cleaners<br>
As they do their best to make the world a better place<br>
We only have Mother Earth to call our own<br>
Let’s be responsible!<br>
Let’s slow down global warming<br>
To save the artic animals<br>
Let’s all respect Mother Earth!<br>

**Poem : The Ripple Effect of Kindness**

A lonely boy walked alone<br>
He was known to few<br>
Walking along the corridor<br>
All he did was count the doors<br>
He was like a small helpless mouse<br>
How he wished he wasn’t in a mess right now

It was a sunny day<br>
Until the bully came<br>
Hurtful words were thrown at the boy<br>
Leaving him in tears and fear<br>
Tears rolled down his face<br>
Like water droplets on a rainy day<br>
It felt like even the doors were mocking him<br>
The boy felt helpless with nobody to turn to<br>

Suddenly a hand reached out<br>
Comforting words were spoken<br>
The voice was calm and the words were kind<br>
The boy grew more resilient<br>
The grey clouds above him disappeared

He ignored the bullies and stood up for himself<br>
It was a girl<br>
Her smile was warm as the sun<br>
She was a dream<br>
A true blessing<br>
She gave him hope in dark times<br>
He picked himself up again

Caring does not cost a penny<br>
A tiny act of kindness<br>
Could pick someone up from their darkest moments<br>
And brighten their day
