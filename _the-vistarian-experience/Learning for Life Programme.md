The aims of Life Long Learning Programme is to provide students with authentic and meaningful experiences to develop values and 21 CC. The Life Long Learning Programme in NV is designed in alignment to our School Vision - Vistarians of Character who learn, strive and contribute for a better future.  
  
Through the platforms of photography and videography, students will appreciate different perspectives, learn communication skills, and empathise with others through creative and inventive thinking. We strive to provide opportunities to help students deepen their skills in photography and videography, thereafter contribute in the production of Storyboard/Videos/Short-films that will help to promote school values.
