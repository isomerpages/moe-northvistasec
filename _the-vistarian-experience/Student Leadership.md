iii. Providing platforms for student leaders to demonstrate leadership qualities

iv. Providing opportunities for Specialised League student leaders to be leadership mentors

**Our desired outcomes of NV Student Leaders**  

We want all NV Student Leaders to…

1. Be responsible decision makers with a compassion for others

2. Be exemplary in their actions

3. Collaborate with others and build harmonious teams

4. Lead with humility, confidence and integrity

5. Envision goals and empower others

**Leadership Training**

Every Vistarian will be equipped with basic leadership skills through their level camps conducted yearly from Secondary 1 to 3. In addition, students will have the opportunity to apply the values, knowledge and skills learn through their leadership roles at class, CCA or school level.
