**Every Vistarian a dynamic leader with the heart to serve**  

&nbsp;The Student Leadership Committee is committed to:

i. Providing leadership training to all Vistarians

ii. Identifying students with leadership potential and developing them through further training and conferring a position of responsibility on them

iii. Providing platforms for student leaders to demonstrate leadership qualities

iv. Providing opportunities for Specialised League student leaders to be leadership mentors

v. Recognising student leaders through the LEAPS 2.0 framework

**Our desired outcomes of NV Student Leaders**  

We want all NV Student Leaders to…

1. Be responsible decision makers with a compassion for others

2. Be exemplary in their actions

3. Collaborate with others and build harmonious teams

4. Lead with humility, confidence and integrity

5. Envision goals and empower others

**Leadership Training**

In NV, we identify a Servant Leader as one who practices 3 key Habits. These Habits begin with a HEART that desires to serve. It is followed by the HEAD that learns to lead. Finally, it culminates in the HAND that dares to act. We believe these habits will help instill in our students the qualities we wish to see in a student leader.

Every Vistarian will be equipped with basic leadership skills through their level camps and cohort leadership training sessions conducted annually from Secondary 1 to 3. Trainings and platforms are provided to engage cognitive, emotional and hands-on aspects to fully immerse our students in the experience as they take on leadership roles at the class, CCA or school level.
		 
### NV Student Leadership Opportunities

There are 3 groups of Student Leaders in North Vista – Prefectorial Board, CCA Leaders and Class Committee.

*   Organisation and support for school-wide events (e.g. NV Open House, Sec 1 Orientation)
*   Spearheading self-initiated activities (e.g. VIA projects)

**CCA Leaders**  

CCA leaders work closely with the teachers-in-charge and coaches to lead and motivate CCA members to work towards CCA goals.
