The Student Development Team (SDT) monitor and support studentsâ€™ development across the whole level. The team coordinates the programmes for the development of each student as he/she experiences the holistic education programmes designed for him/her. The synergy between the various departments helped to facilitate values-in-action programmes, pastoral care programmes and other initiatives to strengthen the rapport between teachers and students.
