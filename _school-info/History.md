North Vista Secondary School has a long and illustrious history.

It started as Gan Eng Seng Government Chinese Middle School in 1956. It was one of the four Chinese Middle Schools opened by the government to provide a conducive and safe environment for students who wanted to complete their education. It was renamed as Thomson Government Chinese Middle School in 1959.

Eventually, after much construction, in 1959, Thomson Secondary moved to its first school building at 5000 Thomson Road. The school grounds were much larger and allowed for a single session.&nbsp;The new compound was also equipped with basic cookery facilities, special room facilities and more.
