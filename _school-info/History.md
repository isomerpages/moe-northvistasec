North Vista Secondary School has a long and illustrious history.

It started as Gan Eng Seng Government Chinese Middle school in 1957. It was one of the four Chinese Middle Schools opened by the government to provide a conducive and safe environment for students who wanted to complete their education. It was renamed as Thomson Government Chinese Middle School in 1959.

Eventually, after much construction, in 1959,Thomson Secondary moved to its first school building at 5000 Thomson Road. The school grounds was much larger and allowed for a single session. The new compound was also equipped with basic cookery facilities, special room facilities and more.

Eventually, Thomson Government Chinese Middle School and Thomson Vocational School merged to become Thomson Secondary School. It conducted lower secondary, upper secondary and pre-university classes.

Mr Chen See How returned as the Principal of Thomson Secondary School (德新中学) at Thomson Road from 1963 to 1972. He was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 1970. Under his guidance and leadership, Thomson Secondary flourished.

As a strong believer in holistic learning experience for all his students, Thomson Secondary School students saw its first Science Laboratory constructed in Thomson Secondary. Students were now given a first-hand experience of scientific experiments.
