North Vista's iconic campus is not just a mere physical structure; it is a hub of creativity and enterprise. Numerous bazaars, lunch rock concerts, project exhibitions and other innovative activities keep the campus sizzling with life throughout the year.

Our school logo is shaped like a globe with two hands supporting it. The globe represents a desire to develop a global outlook whilst the golden glow on the globe signifies a new beginning. The two supporting hands show the support for our students' quest for knowledge, innovation and enterprise. The stylised and bold 'NV' symbol advocates a vibrant school. The effervescent school motto, Viva La Vista, symbolises the philosophy and vision of North Vista. The ring around the globe represents an all-round development to achieve the desired outcomes of education.

Lyrics (starts from the eighth second):  
  
We will stand up for North Vista <br> 
With pride and commitment  <br>
We'll triumph in knowledge and wisdom  <br>
To give our school a name  
  
Let all our hearts be strong and stirring  <br>
Our colours flying high  <br>
In whatever we endeavour  <br>
We shall do the best we can  
  
Come heed the call, Vistarians  <br>
Onward we shall go  <br>
With honour and glory before us  <br>
Viva La Vista!
