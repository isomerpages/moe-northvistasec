NV’s 66th Speech and Prize Presentation has taken on a refreshed format.  We have heard our students’ feedback and created bite-sized video clips, so that viewers can choose to view clips featuring specific categories of awards. 

Our theme for this year, “Achieving our Aspirations”, is a celebration of students’ attainment of excellence in NV. 

We celebrate with our academic awardees who have worked diligently and excelled in the various subjects undertaken.  We also present to you the Secondary Four students who received the Outstanding Leadership Award - notwithstanding their busy academic commitments, these students worked tirelessly to lead the student body in their various classes, CCA and Leadership committees. 

As part of the Speech and Prize Presentation ceremony, we also express our appreciation to our School Advisory Committee (SAC) members for their unstinting support of the school throughout their years of service. 

Last but not least, we celebrate our teachers: The NV Long Service Awards are presented to teachers who have served the school for 5, 10 or 15 years.  We also applaud the group of teachers who have received nominations for the Caring Teacher Award.  

For each category of award, the clip begins with our Principal, Mr Yap Thiam Chuan’s delivery of the School Report, and ends with our Head Prefect, Nabil’s Vote of Thanks.
