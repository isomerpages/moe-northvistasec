# **Introduction to Blended Learning**
# 
Blended Learning aims to provide students a seamless blend of different modes of learning.

**Key intended outcomes:**

*   Nurture self-directed and independent learners
    
*   Develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners

A main aspect of Blended Learning is the integration of **home-based learning** as a regular feature of the schooling experience.
