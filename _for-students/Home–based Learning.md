# **Introduction to Blended Learning**
Blended Learning aims to provide students a seamless blend of different modes of learning.

**Key intended outcomes:**

*   Nurture self-directed and independent learners
    
*   Develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners

A main aspect of Blended Learning is the integration of **home-based learning** as a regular feature of the schooling experience.

**Features of Home-Based Learning**

*   Loosely structured for students to be self-directed in learning
    
*   Dedicated time and space for students to learn at their own pace, explore their interests and learn outside the curriculum
    
*   Includes both ICT and non-ICT modes for teaching and learning
    
*   Frequency: Once a fortnight, approximately 10% of curriculum time.
