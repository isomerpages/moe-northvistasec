<p>Our boys faced Yishun Town Secondary School (YTSS) once again in a thrilling
battle for 3rd place. Having narrowly lost to YTSS in the quarter-finals
(53-57 in overtime), they were eager for redemption. This time, the teams
were evenly matched, ending regulation time in a draw. In a nail-biting
overtime period, our boys fought hard and emerged victorious with an <strong>86-82</strong> win!</p>
