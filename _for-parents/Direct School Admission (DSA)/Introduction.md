### **Introduction**

North Vista Secondary School (NV) is conducting the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise to admit Secondary 1 students for the academic year 2024.&nbsp; We are looking for students who have a strong passion for physical education and have a talent in sports such as Track and Field, Basketball, Football, Netball and Golf. Talented students in performing arts such as Modern Dance, Chinese Dance, Concert Band, Choir and String Ensemble are most welcomed to apply. These students will be given opportunities to further develop their potential in their CCA.

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.** 

**Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.**
