**Introduction**

North Vista Secondary School (NV) is conducting the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise to admit Secondary 1 students for the academic year 2024.Â  We are looking for students who have a strong passion for physical education and have a talent in sports such as Track and Field, Basketball, Football, Netball and Golf. Talented students in performing arts such as Modern Dance, Chinese Dance, Concert Band, Choir and String Ensemble are most welcomed to apply. These students will be given opportunities to further develop their potential in their CCA.

The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early-May.
